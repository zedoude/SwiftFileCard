# SwiftFilePackage
Swift portage of Apple's macOS example "Using NSPageController"
Apple's original code can be found at https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/FileCards/Introduction/Intro.html

This portage to Swift was made as an exercise to understand how to use Cocoa's NSPageController class in Swift.
